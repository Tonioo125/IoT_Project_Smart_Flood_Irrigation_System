# 💧 smart\_water

Welcome to **smart\_water** — a Flutter app that’s all about keeping an eye on your water system in a smarter way. 🚰✨

Instead of staring at pipes and pumps all day, this app lets you check water levels, pump status, and all the good stuff right from your phone.

---

## 🚀 What this app does

* Shows you **real-time water levels** (so you know when things are getting low or overflowing).
* Lets you **turn pumps on/off** without leaving your comfy chair.
* Connects with your **ESP32 IoT setup** (or whatever smart hardware you’re using).
* Gives you a clean and simple dashboard so you don’t have to dig around for info.

---

## 🛠️ How it works

* **ESP32 + sensors** → collect water level data.
* **Firebase / MQTT** → sends the data to the cloud.
* **Flutter app (this one)** → grabs that data and shows it in a nice UI.

Basically: *Tank > ESP32 > Cloud > Phone > You.* ✅

---

## 📱 Features we’re adding (soon™)

* Notifications when water is too high/low.
* Graphs for tracking water usage over time.
* Dark mode (because everything needs dark mode 🌙).
* Multi-reservoir monitoring.

---

## 🤓 Tech used

* **Flutter** for the app.
* **Firebase** (Realtime DB / Firestore).
* **MQTT** for pump control.
* **ESP32-S3** as the brain of the IoT system.
